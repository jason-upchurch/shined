I was a member of the tiger team responsible for leading the [Natural Gas Storage Dashboard](https://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/storage/dashboard/) project. This project was a focusd, multi-month endeavor which led to the successful launch of the product in August 2018.

I served several roles on the project: Python developer, user experience/user interface designer, and subject matter expert. 

My most notable contribution to the project was adapting and integrating an [interface](https://github.com/jason-upchurch/ncep/tree/master) I wrote in Python to extract, transform, and load publicly accessible weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

The project team was managed using the Agile development methodology and benefited from a diverse team consisting of senior leadership, (Agile) project management, subject matter experts, and both federal and contractor developers.
