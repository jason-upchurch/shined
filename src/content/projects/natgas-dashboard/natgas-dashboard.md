I was core member of the tiger team responsible for leading the creation of the US Energy Information Administration's  [Natural Gas Storage Dashboard](https://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/storage/dashboard/). This Agile project was a a multi-month endeavor, and the product successfully launched in August 2018.

My most notable contribution to the project was adapting and integrating an [interface](https://github.com/jason-upchurch/ncep/tree/master) I wrote in Python to extract, transform, load (ETL) and visualize publicly accessible weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This functionality was used in all of the weather-related widgets on the site and the data are refreshed automatically on a daily basis.

The tiger team worked in an Agile environment and benefited from a diverse team consisting of senior leadership, (Agile) project management, subject matter and industry experts, and both federal and contractor developers.

While I've developed software throughout my professional career, I credit this experience with motivating my interest in Agile and production-level software development.
