I supported the [Unmanned Aircraft in the National Airspace System (UAS in the NAS) Project](https://www.nasa.gov/aeroresearch/programs/iasp/uas/description/) from May 2012--July 2016 as a Research Computer Engineer at NASA Langley Research Center. 

On the UAS in the NAS Project, I worked primarily on Sense and Avoid (SAA) as well as Certification, and my day-to-day duties were to conduct fundamental research to advance the safe integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into civil airspace. The investigative tools our team used in this work included computer simulations, formal proofs using automated theorem provers, and human-in-the-loop experiments.

My most notable contribution to the project was in designing and implementing an experiment to assess how selecting different values of a parameter affected key safety properties for a set of related _well-clear_ definitions. This work built on---and was only possible because of---the years of sustained effort by researchers across NASA and other agencies and organizations.
